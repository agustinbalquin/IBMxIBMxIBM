# IBM Watson - SBHacks 2016 submission- IBM Watson API challenge winner

This Project was created with Node-Red on the bluemix platform. This code is only the simulated data that was run on the raspberry pi. The program filtering the data is present on bluemix and connects to an arduino with python scripts edited by Agustin Balquin and Gustavo Correa. Jiunn Siow configured the leap motion technology that allows us to "swipe" left and right to navigate through the LED interfaces.
Currently we are attempting to improve on the project and are currently configuring the Node-Red backend deployment to a server, as well as the hardware wiring of "Watson" using better IC's.
This project was created in under 36 hours during UCSB's hackathon in 2016. It recieved multiple commenations including the IBM Watson API challenge.

# Device Simulator Overview

What if you're building or testing Internet of Things (IoT) solutions based on the [IBM IoT Platform][iotf_url] service ... but don't have an actual device to connect to it? Even if you have a device, maybe you want it to emit specific types and patterns of data?

This is a heavily commented node.js application, that acts as a "fake device", connects to the IBM IoT Platform service and emits data. The type and pattern of data can easily be controlled via a few lines of code.

For a full specification of the payload, see the IBM IoT Platform docs, specifically the [MQTT Connectivity for Devices section][iotf_messaging_doc].


### Registering the simulator in the IBM IoT Platform service

**Note** that this simulated device **can only connect to your instance of the IBM IoT Platform service if it has been registered**. This can either be done via the [IoT Platform dashboard][iotf_dashboard_doc] or [its API][iotf_api].

Make sure to use the following information when registering this app as device:

    Device ID : "my-device-simulator"
    Device Token: "mydevicesimulatortoken"
    Device Type : "device-simulator"
    Device Authentication method : "token"

## Running the application locally

The application uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Start at step 2 if you have them installed already.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (this will also install npm)

2. Go to the project folder in the terminal and install the required npm modules:  
    `npm install`

3. Generate an .env file containing the information that you used to register the device simulator in your IoT Platform organization:
    ```
    iotf_org=<myOrg>
    iotf_type=<myDeviceType>
    iotf_id=<myId>â€š
    iotf_authtoken=<myAuthToken>
    ```

4. Start the application:  
    `node app.js`


## What's Next?

- [ ] IBM Watson Speech to Text recognition with LCD output display
- 
- [ ] Mobile Watson integration
- 
- [ ] Full node.js server configuration beyone Node-Red GUI

- [ ] More Leap Motion functions and smoother interface interaction

- [ ] Raspberry Pi Amazon Alexa + IBM Watson
